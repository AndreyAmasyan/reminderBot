# reminderBot

This bot is able to save links that are sent and, upon request, send a random link from the saved ones. 
This is useful for those people who often save a lot of articles but forget to read them. 
The code is written in such a way that it can be easily extended. 
For example, you can easily add an implementation for any other messenger to it by adding the appropriate client.
